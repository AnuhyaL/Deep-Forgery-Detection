Image falsification, or tampering with images, challenges the integrity of visual data, which is crucial for legal and forensic investigations. This  study introduces  a deep learning-based approach using  Inception ResNet V2 for image forgery detection. Integrated  with the MTCNN framework and enhanced by the Smooth Grad visualization technique, the model demonstrates high detection accuracy. A  dataset  of  original  and  falsified  images  undergoes preprocessing, including resizing and denoising. The trained model  demonstrates  its  durability  in  identifying  image authenticity  with  an  astonishing  98%  accuracy.  This research  underscores  the  effectiveness  of  the  integrated Inception ResNet V2, MTCNN, and Smooth Grad models, providing  a  reliable  and  accessible  tool  for  both professionals  and  the  general  public  to  ensure  image integrity and trustworthiness in digital media
